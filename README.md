# Dijkstra's Algorithm

Recall the pseudocode for Dijkstra's algorithm:
- initialize the dist to each vertex to $\infty$, source to 0
- while there are unmarked vertices left in the graph
    - select the unmarked vertex $v$ with the lowest dist
    - mark $v$ with distance dist
    - for each edge $(v,w)$
        - dist($w$) = min $\left(\textrm{dist}(w), \textrm{dist}(v) + \textrm{weight of }(v, w)\right)$

Implement Dijkstra's algorithm. Start with the template I provided in `code.js`
and test your new function.

I have not provided any test code, but you can base yours on test code from
other exercises. Your tests must check the correctness of the result of running
the function and run automatically when you commit through a GitHub action.

The choice of data structures is up to you -- your implementation does not have
to be the most efficient one, but please make sure that it is not unnecessarily
inefficient.

## Answer

My for loop that is setting initial  distances to nodes runs $|V|$ times. My while loop will also run $|V|$ times. 

The most expensive operation inside my while loop is the standard sort() function, which is generally $|VlogV|$. My while loop is $|V*VlogV|$ which equals $|V^2logV|$.

Also, for each vertext that is processed, all adjacent edges are checked. This is $|E|$ time.



I now have $|V| + |V^2logV| + |E| âˆˆ |\Theta V^2logV|$
